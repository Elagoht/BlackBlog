# Black Blog

This is my own design for my (currently) private website. I planned this web design for publishing my blogs about linux.

This design supports:

* light/dark theme
* font config
* text align config
* font size config
* responsive design

I'm plannig to use this design when I release my (currently) private site.

You can be inspired by this design, but please do not use this design. I will not create a COPYING file to this repository.
